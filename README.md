IGComp

an ongoing project for analysis of igc files and competion results

i believe it is only running in python 2.7 and not on python 3.x

download igc_lib from github and unzip. put folder somewhere.
https://github.com/xiadz/igc_lib

use import igc_lib if you want to use the library

you might need xml.etree




TODO: list of install packages

TODO: currently, trying to find a way to convert the XCTrack xctsk file into a .cup file so that igc_lib can read the task file
